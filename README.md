# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:

### When financial institutions choose to lend money, it can be difficult to assess risk. Numerous external factors exist, late payments, refusal to pay, and defaulting. In this project, we created random datapoints and utilized machine learning models to help determine future risk assessment.

## Results:

### We used 6 different machine learning models and techniques to evaluate prediction models. Naive random sampling, SMOTE sampling, Undersampling, Combination sampling, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, Easy Ensemble Adaboost.

* ### Naive RS
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### SMOTE
* * Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Undersampling
* * Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Combination
*  Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
*  Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:
* ### Easy Ensemble Adaboost
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:
Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
## Summary:

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
