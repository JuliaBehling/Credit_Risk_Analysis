# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:

### When financial institutions choose to lend money, it can be difficult to assess risk. Numerous external factors exist, late payments, refusal to pay, and defaulting. In this project, we created random datapoints and utilized machine learning models to help determine future risk assessment.

## Results:

### We used 6 different machine learning models and techniques to evaluate prediction models. Naive random sampling, SMOTE sampling, Undersampling, Combination sampling, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, Easy Ensemble Adaboost.

* ### Naive RS
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### SMOTE
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Undersampling
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Combination
*  Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:

* ### Easy Ensemble Adaboost
* Balanced Accuracy Score: Precision Score: Recall Score:


## Summary:

We utilized 3 different types of sampling methods, undersampling, oversampling, and combination sampling. When choosing a machine learning method, one wants high levels of recall and precision. I would reccommend the usage of Easy Ensemble Adaboost as it was high in both categories.
